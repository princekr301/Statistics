Handling skewed data is crucial for accurate statistical analysis and modeling. Here are some common techniques to handle skewed data:

Transformation of Data:
Log Transformation: Apply the natural logarithm to your data. This is effective for right-skewed data.
Square Root Transformation: Use the square root of your data values. This is less aggressive than log transformation.
Box-Cox Transformation: A more flexible transformation that can handle both right and left-skewed data.

Using Robust Statistical Techniques:
Median and Interquartile Range (IQR): Instead of using mean and standard deviation, use median and IQR as they are less sensitive to skewness.
Rank-Based Methods: Use non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, which do not assume normality.

Outlier Detection and Treatment:
Identify Outliers: Use methods like the Z-score or IQR method to detect outliers.
Handle Outliers: Depending on the context, you can remove, cap (winsorize), or transform outliers.

Use Different Models:
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): These models can handle skewed data by using different link functions.
Quantile Regression: This type of regression is useful for understanding the impact of variables across different points of the distribution.


Resampling Methods:
Bootstrap Sampling: Use bootstrapping to estimate the sampling distribution and make inferences without assuming normality.
Consider Using Appropriate Distributions:

If you are dealing with skewed continuous data, consider using distributions that can model skewness, such as the Gamma or Beta distributions.
